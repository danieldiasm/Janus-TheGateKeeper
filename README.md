# Janus - The Gate Keeper

Janus is a system for controlling automatic garage doors using bluetooth as configuration interface via serial commands.

It is a very simple system, with a long and not very well crafted code. It was some of my first cool embedded projects back then, when I've started with nicer C++ coding and get better with electronics...

### I keep it here only for historic purposes.

** This is an old project and it is no longer maintained, I've put this here for you to get and use as is. **

## Libraries

Nothing special, it onle reads some GPIO and talks through serial to bluetooth interface.

## Installation

This is needed only an arduino with a HC-06 sensor on Serial Interface.
